    "# Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is a cryptographic process that creates a unique representation of any size data in a fixed-size string of characters. Hashing is used to verify the integrity of files, folders, and volumes of information because if anything associated with that hashed data changes, the subsequent hash output will also change, indicating a change has been made to the file, folder, or volume of information that has been hashed. Hashing is a one-way algorithm. Mathematically, it is not possible to reverse the hashing algorithm and determine the plaintext input that was used to create the hash. Strong hash algorithms include the Secure Hash Algorithms SHA-3, SHA-512, SHA-256, Whirlpool."

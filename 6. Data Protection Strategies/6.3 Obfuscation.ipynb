    "Code obfuscation is a technique that makes the source code of an application difficult to reverse-engineer. This is accomplished by applying various transformations to the source code, making it difficult for humans to understand, while maintaining the code viability and functional execution; meaning that unobfuscated and obfuscated code both execute the same way, but the obfuscated code is very difficult for humans to read and understand. The JSON code produced with JavaScript is an example of obfuscated code."
